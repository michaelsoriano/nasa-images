[{"copyright":"Stephen Mudge","date":"2017-07-05","explanation":"On July 3rd, planet Earth reached aphelion, the farthest point in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. Each year, this day of the most distant Sun happens to occur during winter in the southern hemisphere. That's where this aphelion sunrise from 2015 was captured in a time series composite against the skyline of Brisbane, Australia. Of course, seasons for our fair planet are not determined by distance to the Sun, but by the tilt of Earth's rotational axis with respect to the ecliptic, the plane of its orbit. Fondly known as the obliquity of the ecliptic, the angle of the tilt is about 23.4 degrees from perpendicular to the orbital plane. So the most distant sunrise occurs during northern summer, when the planet's north pole is tilted toward the Sun and the north enjoys longer, warmer days.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/AphelionSunrise_StephenMudge.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Aphelion Sunrise","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/AphelionSunrise_StephenMudge1024.jpg"},{"date":"2017-07-06","explanation":"Atlas, Daphnis, and Pan are small, inner, ring moons of Saturn, shown at the same scale in this montage of images from the still Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft. In fact, Daphnis was discovered in Cassini images from 2005. Atlas and Pan were first sighted in images from the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. Flying saucer-shaped Atlas orbits near the outer edge of Saturn's bright A Ring while Daphnis orbits inside the A Ring's narrow Keeler Gap and Pan within the A Ring's larger Encke Gap. The curious equatorial ridges of the small ring moons could be built up by the accumulation of ring material over time. Even diminutive Daphnis makes waves in the ring material as it glides along the edge of the Keeler Gap.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/PIA21449AtlasDaphnisPan.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Atlas, Daphnis, and Pan","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/PIA21449AtlasDaphnisPan_fig1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Peter Feltoti","date":"2017-07-07","explanation":"Big, bright, beautiful spiral, Messier 106 dominates this cosmic vista. The two degree wide telescopic field of view looks toward the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, near the handle of the Big Dipper. Also known as NGC 4258, M106 is about 80,000 light-years across and 23.5 million light-years away, the largest member of the Canes II galaxy group. For a far away galaxy, the distance to M106 is well-known in part because it can be directly measured by tracking this galaxy's remarkable maser, or microwave laser emission. Very rare but naturally occuring, the maser emission is produced by water molecules in molecular clouds orbiting its active galactic nucleus. Another prominent spiral galaxy on the scene, viewed nearly edge-on, is NGC 4217 below and right of M106. The distance to NGC 4217 is much less well-known, estimated to be about 60 million light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/Messier106_NGC4217Feltoti.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A View Toward M106","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/Messier106_NGC4217Feltoti1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"T. Rector","date":"2017-07-08","explanation":"Similar in size to large, bright spiral galaxies in our neighborhood, IC 342 is a mere 10 million light-years distant in the long-necked, northern constellation Camelopardalis. A sprawling island universe, IC 342 would otherwise be a prominent galaxy in our night sky, but it is hidden from clear view and only glimpsed through the veil of stars, gas and dust clouds along the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy. Even though IC 342's light is dimmed by intervening cosmic clouds, this sharp telescopic image traces the galaxy's own obscuring dust, blue star clusters, and glowing pink star forming regions along spiral arms that wind far from the galaxy's core. IC 342 may have undergone a recent burst of star formation activity and is close enough to have gravitationally influenced the evolution of the local group of galaxies and the Milky Way.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/ic342_rector2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hidden Galaxy IC 342","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/ic342_rector1024s.jpg"},{"date":"2017-07-09","explanation":"Can you find your favorite country or city?  Surprisingly, on this world-wide nightscape, city lights make this task quite possible.  Human-made lights highlight particularly developed or populated areas of the Earth's surface, including the seaboards of Europe, the eastern United States, and Japan.  Many large cities are located near rivers or oceans so that they can exchange goods cheaply by boat.  Particularly dark areas include the central parts of South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.  The featured composite was created from images that were collected during cloud-free periods in April and October 2012 by the Suomi-NPP satellite, from a polar orbit about 824 kilometers above the surface, using its Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/EarthAtNight_SuomiNPP_3600.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Earth at Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/EarthAtNight_SuomiNPP_1080.jpg"},{"date":"2017-07-10","explanation":"What's happening around the center of this spiral galaxy? Seen in total, NGC 1512 appears to be a barred spiral galaxy -- a type of spiral that has a straight bar of stars across its center.  This bar crosses an inner ring, though, a ring not seen as it surrounds the pictured region. Featured in this Hubble Space Telescope image is a \"nuclear ring\" -- one that surrounds the nucleus of the spiral.  The two rings are connected not only by a bar of bright stars but by dark lanes of dust. Inside of this nuclearring, dust continues to spiral right into the very center -- possibly the location of a large black hole. The rings are bright with newly formed stars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/NGC1512_Schmidt_1342.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Spiral Galaxy NGC 1512: The Nuclear Ring","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1707/NGC1512_Schmidt_960.jpg"}]
